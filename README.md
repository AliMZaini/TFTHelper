# Win Tracker
Tracks wins, loses and positions for every game and shows your winrate and average position. Requires manual input after every game.

# Champion Notifier
When a champion you want appears on screen you will be notified by a sound so you don't miss it.
Works by taking a screenshot of the game and analysing it.
Still need to add all champions and make it more usable before releasing.

# Item Notifier
This feature requires a lot of work, but the intention is to have it track items as they appear and use Machine Learning to help suggest what items you go for and build.
