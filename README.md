# Win Tracker
Tracks wins, loses and positions for every game and shows your winrate and average position. Requires manual input after every game.

# Champion Notifier
When a champion you want appears on screen you will be notified by a sound so you don't miss it.
Works by taking a screenshot of the game and analysing it.
Still need to add all champions and make it more usable before releasing.

# Item Notifier
This still requires a lot of work, but the intention is to have it track items as they appear and use Machine Learning to help suggest what items you go for and build.

There are some plans to add ML features to give suggestions on what to build.
